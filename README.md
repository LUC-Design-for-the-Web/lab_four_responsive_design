# Directions
Complete the following steps to make MPLS dob boarding website responsive.

1.  Download and unzip the “lab4” project folder

2.  Open the project folder in your text editor and comment your name at the top the home.html page.

3.  Include the required meta tags discussed in class within the head of your site. The content attributes for each meta tag should be adjusted to reflect site content.

4. **Observing the need for responsive design:** Using Chrome or Firefox browser make sure the site is set to 100% zoom.  Within the browser, inspect the MPLS Dog Boarding homepage by pressing F12.  Slowly reduce the width of the browser by holding the mouse and dragging the edge of the screen into a smaller view.  
    * Underneath the comment that contains your name, Identify at least 1 areas of the site that would improve the site responsiveness and appeal at smaller screen widths. Keep in mind, in most cases a horizontal scroll bar indicates a need for adjustment to make site responsive.

5.  **Implement Media Queries:** Implement two media queries into your site. One media query with a max-width break-point of 1024px and the other with a max-width break-point of 768px.  Test to make sure the media queries work by temporarily changing the presentation of your site at each break-point.

6. **Media Query for Break-point max-width 1024** - Make the follow changes:

    * Override the style rule that targets the 3 aside box elements and change the height value to auto
    * Override the style rule that targets the ```<main id=”flexcontainer”>``` element and change the background-size value to auto.
